Comment: The file mentions that it is based on jsqrencode, which is licensed
 under the GPL v3. This means qr.js should not be able to be licensed under
 MIT, unless they have gotten explicit permission from upstream to relicense
 under the MIT license. I have asked upstream for clarification:
 https://github.com/neocotic/qr.js/issues/23
 For now, the file is removed from the repackaged upstream tarball, and not
 distributed as part of this package.
